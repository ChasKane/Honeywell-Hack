This is my folder for everything to do with my home AC hacking project. The goal of this project is to make something like a NEST Thermostat, but I'm breaking the journey up into subgoals -- first, I intend to understand how my house is wired, so that I don't risk the AC getting a LITTLE TOO HOT during the wintertime if you catch my drift.

Then, I'll strive to upgrade my current system to a raspberry-pi with wireless internet access and server integration so that I can set the temp with my phone, perhaps via a text to the right number or an email to the right address.

Once that works, I'll have it learn my behavior combined with efficiency based on weather.

So far, I have a number of links that I've found useful in getting me through phase one. I'll update this folder with a diagram when I have better knowledge of how my house AC works, along with a picture for anyone interested.
